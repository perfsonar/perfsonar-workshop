perfSONAR deployment for workshops and training
===============================================

This is a set of Ansible playbooks and roles that is suitable to install a full [perfSONAR][ps] environment on multiple machines.  It is suitable for a workshop or training setup but can also serve as a starting point for a fully customised perfSONAR deployment on any network.

Requirements
------------

The deployment is meant to work with any perfSONAR supported distro:

  - CentOS: http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_centos.html
  - Debian/Ubuntu: http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_debian.html

The hosts will all be managed through Ansible and for that this setup relies on a [fork][tonin-bootstrap] of the [robertdebock.bootstrap][rdbs] role to make all machines working with Ansible.  I also make use of a [simple users management role][tonin-users] to create and manage the admin users on the machines.  You can skip that parts of the setup and provide your own provisioning roles and playbooks taking care of that in your infrastructure.

At the core of the `site.yml` playbook are the [perfsonar-testpoint][ps-testpoint] and [perfsonar-toolkit][ps-toolkit] roles which are making most of the job.

Playbook Variables
------------------

After checking out this repo and creating a new branch for the specific deployment I'm doing, I usually adapt the following variables for my deployment needs:

  - `ps_domain` as a fake domain to use between the lab hosts (but can also be used to define all your hosts hostname, see playbook/corrections.yml)
  - `edupert_username` as the username that workshop participants will use to connect to the lab hosts
  - `edupert_timezone` to set a time zone that is the same as where the workshop is happening
  - `perfsonar_web_user`and `perfsonar_web_passwd` to define the define the credential used to access the perfSONAR toolkit admin GUI
  - `perfsonar_optional_packages` is the list of additional optional packages you want to install with the testpoint bundle, see [the debian list][debian-optional] and [the centos list][centos-optional] for more information.  All optional packages are installed per default.
  - `perfsonar_ntp_servers`: depending on the place where the setup is established, I use close and reliable NTP servers,
  - and of course the list and characteristics of user accounts.

There is also some provision, in the inventory file as well as in the roles, to use different types of perfSONAR installation, namely: stable, staging or snapshot packages.

Usage
-----

In its simplest form, this playbook and roles can be used with the following command:

    ansible-playbook site.yml

It is usually useful to edit the following before running any Ansible command:

  - edit `inventory/hosts`
  - remove any unneeded directory under `inventory/group_vars/` or edit exisiting files
  - remove any unneeded directory under `inventory/host_vars/` or edit exisiting files
  - change the domain in `inventory/group_vars/all/perfsonar.yml`
  - change the user list in `inventory/group_vars/all/users.yml`
  - create a vault password in `secret` and remove/create/edit `inventory/group_vars/all/crypt.yml`

Tags
----

Some tags are useful when invoking this setup, they are meant to run only, or skip, a part of the process.  The following tags are existing:

  - `ps::install` : only install perfSONAR packages and their dependencies
  - `ps::config` : only configure any already installed perfSONAR package
  - `ps::running` : checks that your perfSONAR node is running as intended

Examples,

  - If you only want to install the perfSONAR software without configuring it automatically, you can run:

        ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "ps::install"

  - If you have already installed the perfSONAR packages and you only want to change an already existing config, you can run:

        ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags "ps::install"

Dependencies
------------

The [perfsonar-testpoint][ps-testpoint] and [perfsonar-toolkit][ps-toolkit] roles as well as my [bootstrap][tonin-bootstrap] and [users][tonin-users] roles are the main dependencies to this setup.  Git submodules are used to make for an easy starting point.  This means you have 2 different ways to use this setup:

  - use the git submodules, by running `git submodule init; git submodule update` after cloning this repo
  - use Ansible Galaxy (when the perfsonar roles will be published thereâ€¦ which is not yet the case)

Some inventory files are crypted with ansible-vault and the corresponding password is not kept in this git repository, of course!
